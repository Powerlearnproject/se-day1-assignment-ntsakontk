3.	List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle

-	Planning : This phase involves defining the project scope, objectives, and feasibility. Stakeholders identify requirements and create a project plan that outlines timelines, resources, and costs. 
-	Requirements gathering and analysis :  In this phase, developers work with stakeholders to gather detailed requirements. This involves understanding user needs and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of the software.
-	Designing : The design phase involves creating architectural and detailed designs for the software. This includes defining system architecture, user interfaces, and data structures, ensuring that the software meets the specified requirements.
-	Coding : During this phase, developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. This phase includes unit testing to ensure that individual components work correctly before integration
-	Testing : The testing phase involves systematically evaluating the software to identify and fix defects. Different types of testing (e.g., functional, integration, system, and user acceptance testing) are conducted to ensure the software meets requirements and is free of bugs.
-	Deployment :  After successful testing, the software is deployed to the production environment. This phase may involve installation, configuration, and user training to ensure smooth transition and adoption.
-	Maintenance : Once the software is in use, ongoing maintenance is required to address any issues, implement updates, and enhance functionality based on user feedback. This phase ensures the software remains relevant and efficient over time

4.	Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate
-	Waterfall Methodology: The Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to software development. Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next, with little room for revisiting previous stages.
Key Characteristics:
Structured Workflow: Clearly defined phases (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment).
Documentation Heavy: Extensive documentation at each stage.
Limited Flexibility: Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed.
Appropriate Scenarios for Waterfall:

Well-Defined Requirements: Projects with clear and fixed requirements, such as regulatory software in healthcare.
Short-Term Projects: Projects with a strict deadline and minimal changes expected.
Compliance Projects: Situations where documentation and adherence to standards are critical (e.g., government contracts).

-	Agile Methodology: Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. Development is done in small, manageable increments called sprints.
Key Characteristics:
Iterative Process: Continuous cycles of planning, development, and testing.
Flexibility: Adaptation to changing requirements is welcomed throughout development.
Customer Collaboration: Regular feedback from stakeholders and users is integral.
Appropriate Scenarios for Agile:
Dynamic Requirements: Projects where requirements are expected to change frequently, such as web applications or startups looking to adapt quickly to market feedback.
Long-Term Development: Projects requiring ongoing updates and enhancements, like social media platforms.
Innovative Projects: Situations that benefit from frequent user feedback and rapid prototyping, such as mobile app development or a user interface
